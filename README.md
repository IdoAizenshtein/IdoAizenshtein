## 🔍 API Development & Tools

### [🔎 API Compass - Automated API Discovery Tool](https://github.com/IdoAizenshtein/api-compass)
🚀 *An innovative open-source tool that automatically discovers, documents, and tests REST API endpoints.*
- 🔍 **Automated API Discovery**: Intelligently scans web applications to detect API endpoints without manual tracing
- 📝 **Interactive Documentation**: Generates comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation with testing capabilities
- 🔄 **Normalized Endpoints**: Automatically identifies URL patterns and parameters for consistent documentation
- 🛡️ **API Proxy**: Built-in proxy functionality to avoid CORS issues during API testing

## 🤖 AI & Document Intelligence
### [📄 OCR of Documents and Invoices (Python)](https://github.com/IdoAizenshtein/OCR-of-documents-and-invoices-Python)
🚀 *An Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system optimized for extracting data from documents and invoices.*  
- 📃 Accurately processes various document formats, extracting readable text for data analysis.  
- ✨ Integrated with **Python-based OCR libraries** for powerful and scalable text recognition.  
- 🛠️ Ideal for automating invoice processing in enterprise-level document workflows.  
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Tesseract OCR library, Image Processing.

## 🤖 SmartCache
### [📄 Intercepts, caches, and syncs offline HTTP requests (JavaScript)](https://github.com/IdoAizenshtein/smartcache)
SmartCache is a lightweight Service Worker library that can be seamlessly integrated into any website. Once installed, it intercepts all network requests initiated by the page and:
- Caches all GET and HEAD requests via the Cache API under a configurable CACHE_NAME, enabling instant offline retrieval and reduced latency.
- Persists other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) into IndexedDB under a configurable database and store name, ensuring that data-changing operations performed while offline are not lost.
- Automatically replays stored requests when the user returns online, keeping server-side data synchronized without manual intervention.
- Refreshes cached resources on reconnection, so that updated content is fetched and stored for future offline use.
- SmartCache also supports versioning of both the cache and IndexedDB schema, and can broadcast real-time notifications to the client page about cache hits, offline usage, and sync events via postMessage.
